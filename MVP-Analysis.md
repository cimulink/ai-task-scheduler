# AI Task Scheduler MVP Analysis & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
Based on the High Level PRD and PRD documents, your AI Task Scheduler has strong potential but needs focused simplification for MVP. The current scope is too broad for initial market validation.

## Core Value Proposition Analysis
✅ **Strong**: AI-powered project planning for digital agencies
✅ **Strong**: Handling urgent request replanning
✅ **Strong**: Resource allocation optimization
⚠️ **Risk**: Too many features dilute the core value

## MVP Recommendation: "Smart Task Breakdown & Assignment"

### Core MVP Features (Keep)
1. **Project-to-Task Breakdown** (High Level PRD: points 1-2)
   - Input: Client project brief
   - Output: Structured task list with estimates
   - User feedback loop for task refinement

2. **Basic Resource Assignment** (High Level PRD: point 102-103)
   - Simple bandwidth-based matching
   - Show assignments to user for approval

3. **Simple Priority Scoring** (High Level PRD: point 137)
   - LLM-based priority (1-100 scale)
   - User can override/adjust

### Features to DEFER for v2+
❌ **Complex Update Flows**: The entire update schedule workflow is too complex for MVP
❌ **Task Dependencies**: Enhancement feature - defer until core value proven
❌ **Multi-client Comparison**: Focus on single project at a time initially
❌ **Advanced Resource Matching**: Start with bandwidth only, add skills later
❌ **Delta Analysis**: Complex feature that requires established baseline

## What's Missing for MVP

### Critical Gaps
1. **User Authentication & Data Persistence**
   - Basic user accounts
   - Project/task storage
   - Resource profiles

2. **Simple UI/UX Flow**
   - Project input form
   - Task review/edit interface
   - Assignment approval screen

3. **Integration Strategy**
   - Start with CSV export (not live integration)
   - Focus on one PM tool (suggest Asana)

4. **Feedback Collection Mechanism**
   - Built-in feedback forms
   - Usage analytics for PMF validation

### Technical Architecture Gaps
1. **LLM Provider Abstraction** - Already noted, good
2. **Database Schema** - Not specified in PRDs
3. **API Structure** - Client, Project, Task, Resource models
4. **Error Handling** - What happens when LLM fails?

## Simplified MVP User Journey
1. User creates account
2. User inputs single project brief
3. AI generates task breakdown
4. User reviews/edits tasks and estimates
5. User adds team members (resources)
6. AI suggests assignments
7. User approves final schedule
8. Export to CSV or integrate with PM tool

## Success Metrics for PMF Validation
- **Usage**: Do users return to create multiple projects?
- **Accuracy**: Are AI-generated tasks 80%+ accurate?
- **Time Savings**: Does it reduce planning time by 50%+?
- **Satisfaction**: NPS > 50 within first 3 months

## Technical Implementation Priority
1. **Week 1-2**: Core data models + basic LLM integration
2. **Week 3-4**: Task breakdown functionality
3. **Week 5-6**: Resource assignment logic
4. **Week 7-8**: Simple web UI + user testing

## Recommendation
Focus ruthlessly on the "Project Brief → Task List → Resource Assignment" flow. Everything else is nice-to-have. Get this core loop working perfectly before adding complexity.

The current PRDs are comprehensive but too ambitious for MVP. Start smaller, validate the core assumption, then expand.
